A program that enables a Raspberry PI (with proper hardware present) to become a Smart Bell. The Raspberry PI, should be connected to a button and a speaker on the specified GPIO pins for this program to work correctly. The project also includes a REST API used by the smart-bell-android-client(https://github.com/dimchoSCR/smart-bell-android-client)
